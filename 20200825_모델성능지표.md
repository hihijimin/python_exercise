### pose-estimation Evaluation metrics

1. Percentage of Correct Parts - PCP  
- A limb is considered detected and a correct part if the distance between the two predicted joint locations and the true limb joint locations is at most half of the limb length (PCP at 0.5 )  
- Measures detection rate of limbs  
- Cons - penalizes shorter limbs  
- **Calculation**  
  - For a specific part, PCP = (No. of correct parts for entire dataset) / (No. of total parts for entire dataset)  
  - Take a dataset with 10 images and 1 pose per image. Each pose has 8 parts - ( upper arm, lower arm, upper leg, lower leg ) x2  
  - No of upper arms = 10 * 2 = 20  
  - No of lower arms = 20  
  - No of lower legs = No of upper legs = 20  
  - If upper arm is detected correct for 17 out of the 20 upper arms i.e 17 ( 10 right arms and 7 left) → PCP = 17/20 = 85%  
- Higher the better  

2. Percentage of Correct Key-points - PCK  
- Detected joint is considered correct if the distance between the predicted and the true joint is within a certain threshold (threshold varies)  
- PCKh@0.5 is when the threshold = 50% of the head bone link  
- PCK@0.2 == Distance between predicted and true joint < 0.2 * torso diameter  
- Sometimes 150 mm is taken as the threshold  
- Head, shoulder, Elbow, Wrist, Hip, Knee, Ankle → Keypoints  
- PCK is used for 2D and 3D (PCK3D)  
- Higher the better
