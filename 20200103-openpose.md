- 설치하면서 발생했던 문제: **python에서 import pyopenpose을 할수 없음**  
이거 보면서 해결 했음. 특히 pyopenpose.cp36-win_amd64.pyd 또는 pyopenpose.pyd 파일이 있어야 한다고 보구 vs2015(release)에서 빌드 시켰더니 pyopenpose.cp36-win_amd64.pyd 파일이 생성 되었음 해당 경로에 이 파일이 뙇 넣고나면 파이썬에서 실행 가능했음  

    Problem 2: Python for Openpose needs to be compiled in Release mode for now. This can be done in [Visual Studio](https://cdn.stereolabs.com/docs/getting-started/images/release_mode.png). Once that is done check this line:

    `sys.path.append(dir_path + '/../../python/openpose/Release');`

    ```
    dir ../../python/openpose/Release
    ```

    Check the contents of this location. It should contain one of the following files:

    ```
    pyopenpose.cp36-win_amd64.pyd
    pyopenpose.pyd
    ```

    If such a folder does not exist, you need to compile in Release mode as seen above. If you have the first one, you have compiled PyOpenPose for Python 3, and have to run the scripts with `python3`, and vice versa for the 2nd one. Follow the testing examples above for exact commands. If that still does not work, check this line:

    `os.environ['PATH']  = os.environ['PATH'] + ';' + dir_path + '/../../x64/Release;' +  dir_path + '/../../bin;'`

    ```
    dir ../../x64/Release
    dir ../../bin
    ```

    Ensure that both of these paths exist, as PyOpenPose needs to reference those libraries. If they don't exist, change the path so that they point to the correct location in your build folder.
